# Cross-Chain Privacy Bridge on Mina Using O1js

## Introduction

Blockchain technology offers transparency, but this transparency can sometimes be a drawback when users require financial privacy. Many blockchains, such as Ethereum, expose transaction data publicly, making it possible to trace user activity.

By using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), we can allow users to conduct private transactions between two blockchainsâ€Šâ€”â€Šin this case, Mina Protocol and Ethereumâ€Šâ€”â€Šwithout exposing transaction details to the public. This project builds a **Cross-Chain Privacy Bridge**, enabling users to deposit assets on Ethereum, generate a ZKP proof of the deposit, and privately redeem those assets on Mina.

### Key Features:
- Transaction amounts remain private.
- Sender and receiver identities are hidden.
- Assets are securely transferred across blockchains.

## Project Architecture

### 1. Key Components

The bridge consists of four major components:
1. **Mina Smart Contract (Using O1js)** â€“ Handles zero-knowledge transactions and maintains private balances.
2. **Ethereum Smart Contract (Solidity)** â€“ Accepts deposits, locks assets, and triggers relayer events.
3. **Relayer Service (Node.js + Web3.js + Mina.js)** â€“ Listens to Ethereum events, generates ZKPs, and submits transactions to Mina.
4. **Zero-Knowledge Circuit (O1js)** â€“ Verifies cross-chain transactions without revealing transaction details.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

### 1.1 Install Dependencies

You'll need:
- Node.js (v16+)
- Mina zkApp CLI (zk)
- Hardhat (for Ethereum smart contract development)
- Web3.js & O1js (for blockchain interactions)

Install required dependencies:
```bash
npm install o1js ethers hardhat dotenv mina-signer web3 axios
```

## Step 2: Implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Mina (Using O1js)

Our Mina smart contract will:
- Verify deposits from Ethereum using ZKPs.
- Store balances privately without exposing data on-chain.
- Allow withdrawals only after ZKP verification.

### 2.1 Defining the Private Transaction Circuit

Create a new Mina zkApp Contract:
```js
import {
  Field,
  SmartContract,
  state,
  State,
  method,
  Poseidon,
  PublicKey,
  PrivateKey,
  Signature,
  Proof,
} from "o1js";

class PrivacyBridge extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) private balanceHash = State<Field>();

  @method async deposit(publicKey: PublicKey, amount: Field, signature: Signature) {
    signature.verify(publicKey, [amount]).assertTrue();
    let currentHash = this.balanceHash.get();
    let newBalanceHash = Poseidon.hash([currentHash, amount]);
    this.balanceHash.set(newBalanceHash);
  }

  @method async withdraw(proof: Proof) {
    proof.verify().assertTrue();
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Compile and Deploy the zkApp
Run:
```bash
zk deploy --network berkeley
```

## Step 3: Deploying the Ethereum Smart Contract

On Ethereum, we need a Solidity smart contract that:
- Accepts deposits from users.
- Locks the funds on Ethereum.
- Emits an event to notify the relayer.

### 3.1 Solidity Smart Contract (Bridge.sol)
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract PrivacyBridgeETH {
    mapping(address => uint256) public deposits;
    event Deposit(address indexed user, uint256 amount);

    function deposit() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit must be greater than 0");
        deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Deploy the Ethereum Smart Contract
Using Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Step 4: Implementing the Relayer Service

The relayer is a Node.js service that:
- Listens for deposits on Ethereum.
- Generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP).
- Submits proof to the Mina smart contract for withdrawal processing.

### 4.1 Installing Web3 & Mina SDK
```bash
npm install web3 axios mina-signer
```

### 4.2 Relayer Code (relayer.js)
```js
import Web3 from "web3";
import { Mina, PrivateKey, PublicKey, Field, Proof } from "o1js";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const web3 = new Web3("https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY");
const bridgeContractAddress = "YOUR_ETH_BRIDGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
const bridgeAbi = [...]; // Add ABI here
const minaPrivateKey = PrivateKey.random();
const minaPublicKey = minaPrivateKey.toPublicKey();
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(bridgeAbi, bridgeContractAddress);

contract.events.Deposit({}, async (error, event) => {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  const { user, amount } = event.returnValues;
  console.log(`New deposit from ${user}: ${amount}`);

  const proof = Mina.Proof.create(minaPrivateKey, [amount]);
  console.log("Submitting proof to Mina...");
});
```

### 4.3 Run the Relayer Service
```bash
node relayer.js
```

## Step 5: End-to-End User Flow

1. User deposits ETH â†’ Calls `deposit()` on Ethereum smart contract.
2. Ethereum contract emits event â†’ Relayer listens for deposits.
3. Relayer generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) â†’ Ensures privacy.
4. Relayer submits proof to Mina â†’ Calls `withdraw()` on the zkApp.
5. Mina smart contract verifies proof â†’ User redeems funds privately.

## Enhancements & Next Steps

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Enhancing Privacy with zk-SNARKs
- Improve transaction confidentiality by implementing full zk-SNARK verification.
- Use Mina's Pickles recursive proofs for better efficiency.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Two-Way Bridge Implementation
- Enable Mina-to-Ethereum transactions.
- Implement Ethereum withdrawals using zk-SNARKs.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Security & Attack Prevention
- Prevent front-running with commit-reveal mechanisms.
- Use multi-signature verification for better security.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Adding a UI for User Interaction
- Build a React.js UI to allow users to deposit and withdraw funds easily.
- Integrate MetaMask & Mina wallet for seamless transactions.

## Conclusion

This guide demonstrates how to build a privacy-preserving cross-chain bridge using:
- O1js (Mina) for Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
- Solidity (Ethereum) for asset locking.
- Web3 (Relayer) for transaction bridging.

By leveraging ZKPs, we ensure that user balances, sender details, and transaction history remain confidential.
